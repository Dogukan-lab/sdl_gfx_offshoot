# sdl_gfx_offshoot

This is a stripped down version of [SDL_gfx](https://github.com/ferzkopp/SDL_gfx/tree/master). I needed to use only certain source files, so that is why this repository exists. It assumes you always build SDL2 before using this, so beware. All credits of course go to the original creator of SDL_gfx and its contributors.
